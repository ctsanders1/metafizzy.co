Inktober is a special month-long event where talented illustrators around the world remind me that I'll never be one-tenth as good as an artist. This year, I decided to hop in on the fun. As I'm no proper illustrator, I choose to work on familiar subject matter: modern logos.

Earlier in October, I bought [Logo Modernism](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/graphic_design/all/02879/facts.logo_modernism.htm). What I thought was a handy reference book turned out to be a massive 20 pound tome. It's the size of book a wizards would pour over. Its contents are just as alluring. Logos from the golden area of graphic design.

The techniques on display in Logo Modernism comprise the foundation of contemporary logo design. Forms are simple and precise. Geometric shapes convey abstract concepts. All in black in white.

It was a worthwhile exercise. I spend so much in front a screen. Working with paper and a Sharpie was a welcome respite.
