_[Smalhaus](http://www.smalhaus.com/) is an independent software development studio and retail consultancy._ I worked with boss-man Dustin to deliver a logo that communicated Smalhaus' craftsman qualities. Smalhaus means 'small house.' Don't overthink it. The logo depicts a little abode forming an S, with a door frame and chimney forming a lowercase h.
